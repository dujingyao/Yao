## 🔧 Critical Technical Corrections

### 1. Li → Pi Correction Implementation

#### Original Problem
```
Objective Function: max Σ Li
where Li = interest income from enterprise i
```

#### Corrected Solution
```
Objective Function: max Σ Pi
where Pi = expected profit from enterprise i
Pi = Li - (Expected Loss Rate × Credit Amount)
```

#### Mathematical Formula
```
Pi = ri × Ai - (qi × Ai)
   = Ai × (ri - qi)
   = Ai × Risk-Adjusted Return Rate

where:
- ri = interest rate for enterprise i
- Ai = credit amount for enterprise i  
- qi = expected loss rate for enterprise i
```

### 2. Enhanced Industry Parameter Logic

#### Dynamic Industry Risk Adjustment
```python
def calculate_dynamic_industry_parameters():
    """Calculate industry parameters with macroeconomic factors"""
    base_industry_risk = {
        'Technology': 0.6,
        'Manufacturing': 0.8,
        'Services': 0.9,
        'Construction': 1.3,
        'Retail': 1.0
    }
    
    # Macroeconomic adjustment factors
    macro_factors = {
        'GDP_growth_rate': 0.06,
        'inflation_rate': 0.03,
        'industry_prosperity': {
            'Technology': 0.85,
            'Manufacturing': 0.80,
            'Services': 0.70,
            'Construction': 0.75,
            'Retail': 0.75
        }
    }
    
    adjusted_risk = {}
    for industry, base_risk in base_industry_risk.items():
        prosperity = macro_factors['industry_prosperity'][industry]
        # Risk inversely related to prosperity
        adjusted_risk[industry] = base_risk * (2 - prosperity)
    
    return adjusted_risk
```

### 3. Complete Logistic Regression Implementation

#### Probability Model
```python
def calculate_default_probability(enterprise_data):
    """Calculate default probability using logistic regression"""
    
    # Multi-factor scoring
    financial_score = enterprise_data['financial_status']
    stability_score = enterprise_data['business_stability'] 
    growth_score = enterprise_data['growth_potential']
    efficiency_score = enterprise_data['operational_efficiency']
    market_score = enterprise_data['market_position']
    
    # Weighted comprehensive score
    weights = [0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.12, 0.08]
    comprehensive_score = np.dot([financial_score, stability_score, 
                                 growth_score, efficiency_score, market_score], weights)
    
    # Logistic transformation
    # Default probability decreases as comprehensive score increases
    default_prob = 1 / (1 + np.exp((comprehensive_score - 50) / 10))
    
    return min(max(default_prob, 0.005), 0.4)  # Constrain between 0.5% and 40%

            continue
            
        # Minimum return constraint (Li→Pi correction)
        if enterprise['risk_adjusted_return_rate'] <= 0:
            continue
            
        # Industry concentration constraint

Base Rate = 6.5% (benchmark rate)
Risk Premium = f(Expected Loss Rate, Credit Amount)
Industry Adjustment = f(Industry Risk Factor, Market Conditions)
```

### 3. Dynamic Credit Limit Calculation
```
Credit Limit = min(
    Income-based Limit,
    Risk-adjusted Limit,
    Industry Concentration Limit,
    Budget Constraint Limit
)

Income-based Limit = Annual Revenue × Income Multiplier
Risk-adjusted Limit = Base Limit × (1 - Expected Loss Rate)^1.5
```
